Setup Instructions:

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required Python libraries and packages: Heapq, Networkx, Matplotlib

Execution Instructions:

Input Starting Point:
Upon running the code, you'll be prompted to enter the starting point from which you want to find the most efficient route.

View Results:
After entering the starting point, the application will calculate the shortest paths to all other nodes and recommend the most efficient route to a charging station.
The recommended route and total distance will be displayed in the command line.

Graph Visualization:
Additionally, the application generates a graphical representation of the network graph using Matplotlib. Nodes are depicted as blue circles, while charging stations are highlighted in red.
The graph visualization provides a visual overview of the network topology and recommended routes.

Example:
Enter the starting point: A
The most efficient route from A is to charging station H with a total distance of 16
